```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit & Integration Tests

- Unit and integration tests live in the top-level `tests/` directory and co-located with source files
- Vitest configuration is centralized in `vitest.config.ts`; `tests/setup.ts` wires Testing Library helpers and jsdom globals
- Generate coverage with `pnpm test:coverage` and inspect `coverage/index.html` for gaps before opening a PR

### End-to-End Tests

- E2E tests use Playwright and live in `tests/e2e/`
- Tests cover critical user flows: category browsing, adding to cart, cart management, and cart persistence
- Run with `pnpm test:e2e` or use UI mode with `pnpm test:e2e:ui` for debugging
- Playwright configuration in `playwright.config.ts` includes both desktop and mobile viewports

## üîß Development Workflow

1. Run `pnpm dev` for local development and leverage React Fast Refresh.
2. Keep domain logic in `src/services` or `src/hooks` to maintain thin route handlers.
3. Use `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format:check` before committing; Husky will run lint-staged on staged files.
4. Ensure TypeScript and Vitest pass locally (`pnpm type-check`, `pnpm test`) ahead of each pull request.
